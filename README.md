Directions for this project 


Using an HTML editor, open the Project10.htm and Project10.css files from the download, enter your name and the project due date in the comment section of each file
Replace the rflogo.gif" img element in the header block with an object block, assign the image file rflogo.gif to the data attribute of the object and set the type, widthheight attributes as well; place a paragraph <p> to replace the alt text "The Robert Frost Web Page" from the img within the object block

Scroll down to the figure element directly after the page header. Within the figure element, create an iframe element linking to the YouTube video The Road Not Taken - Robert Frost and add parameters to the URL to disable the ability of users to display the video in full-screen mode. Set the width and height of the object to 320 pixels by 200 pixels. The easiest way to get the iframe code for the video is directly from YouTube as follows:
Click the 'Share' button below the video
Click the 'Embed' button next to the link
Copy the entire iframe code and paste it into your HTML document


Scroll down to the first poem section. Directly below the Fire and Ice h2 heading, insert an audio element with fireice.mp3 and fireice.ogg as the source files. Display the audio controls.

Within the audio element, nest an object element for the fireice.swf Flash player. Set the width and height to 345 pixels by 21 pixels.
Within the object element, nest an embed element for the fireice.swf file, setting the dimensions again to 345 pixels wide by 21 pixels high.

Go to the next poem section. Directly below the Devotion h2 heading, insert nested audio, object, and embed elements (as you did for Steps 4 through 6) for the devotion.mp3, devotion.ogg and devotion.swf files.
Remove the two poems "Fire and Ice" and "Devotion" along with their paragraph <p> tags from this document, and place and save them as the only code within two new HTML document files, fireice.htm and devotion.htm; then embed the code from the two files back into the same location in this "The Robert Frost Web Page" document using object elements; set the height attribute for the "Fire and Ice" object to 250
